    <p class="bio"> I have a BFA in studio art from the University of Texas 
        where I developed a passion for creative thinking and problem solving
        through art and design. My varied work experience post grad illuminated
        my desire to create exceptional experiences for people. This passion has led
        me to wild world of user experience design. Outside of work, you
        will likely find me watching weird movies, hanging by a pool or tending to my ever expanding collection
        of houseplants.
